- Added rotations.
- TODO: Check for penetration energies for rotations.
- 	Account for reflections of particles under PBC for overlaps. 
	(Verify using simple toy model where Ep = 0.) 

Version 1.0
- Implemented shape changes.
- Implemented simulation snapshots that writes text files to workspace/data to test shape changes.
- Number of intersections test checked.
- User is now able to restart simulation with new input parameters by resetting the simulation (new->reset).
